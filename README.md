THE TRASH CLOUD IS TRASH MAGIC HOSTED ON PAID CLOUD HOSING WITH [EASYDNS.COM](https://easydns.com/).

BUY A DOMAIN THAT IS NOT .COM, LIKE A .NET, .ORG, .ART, .XYZ, .SITE ETC!

GET HOSTING!

COPY A TRASH MAGIC REPLICATOR FROM ANY TRASH MAGIC SITE, SERVER OR REPOSITORY!

HERE IS THE LINK TO THE PHP TO DOWNLOAD THE REPLICATOR FOR THE ORGANIC WEB MAIN REPO:

[replicator.php](https://github.com/LafeLabs/ORGANIC-WEB/blob/1a35c22ee1ce2ef7b31c6129013a6928081a61d8/replicator.php)

DOWNLOAD THE FILE AND THEN UPLOAD IT TO THE MAIN WEB DIRECTORY IN YOUR HOSTING ACCOUNT, AFTER LOGGING INTO THE CONTROL PANEL PAGE THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU SIGN UP FOR A HOSTING ACCOUNT!

BE SURE TO TURN OFF  MOD SECURITY SINCE THAT BREAKS TRASH MAGIC!

RUN THE REPLICATOR BY POINTING A BROWSER TO [YOUR WEBSITE ADDRESS]/replicator.php!
